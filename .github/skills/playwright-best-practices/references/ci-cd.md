## GitHub Actions

### Basic Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
          retention-days: 30

### With Sharding

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        shardIndex: [1, 2, 3, 4]
        shardTotal: [4]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shardIndex }}/${{ matrix.shardTotal }}

      - name: Upload blob report
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: blob-report-${{ matrix.shardIndex }}
          path: blob-report
          retention-days: 1

  merge-reports:
    if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
    needs: [test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

        run: npm ci

      - name: Download blob reports
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: all-blob-reports
          pattern: blob-report-*
          merge-multiple: true

      - name: Merge reports
        run: npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-blob-reports

      - name: Upload HTML report

        with:
          name: html-report
          path: playwright-report

```

### With Container

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      # Use latest or more appropriate playwright version (match package.json)
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-jammy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npx playwright test
        env:
          HOME: /root
```

## Docker

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-jammy

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .

CMD ["npx", "playwright", "test"]
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  playwright:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./playwright-report:/app/playwright-report
      - ./test-results:/app/test-results
    environment:
      - CI=true
      - BASE_URL=http://app:3000
    depends_on:
      - app

  app:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t playwright-tests .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/playwright-report:/app/playwright-report playwright-tests

# With docker-compose
docker-compose run --rm playwright
```

## Reporting

### Configuration

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    // Always generate
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],

    // Console output
    ['list'],

    // CI-friendly
    ['github'], // GitHub Actions annotations

    // JUnit for CI integration
    ['junit', { outputFile: 'results.xml' }],

    // JSON for custom processing
    ['json', { outputFile: 'results.json' }],

    // Blob for merging shards
    ['blob', { outputDir: 'blob-report' }],
  ],
});
```

### CI-Specific Reporter

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: process.env.CI ? [['github'], ['blob'], ['html']] : [['list'], ['html']],
});
```

## Sharding

### Command Line

```bash
# Split into 4 shards, run shard 1
npx playwright test --shard=1/4

# Run shard 2
npx playwright test --shard=2/4
```

### Configuration

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // Evenly distribute tests across shards
  fullyParallel: true,

  // For blob reporter to merge later
  reporter: process.env.CI ? [['blob']] : [['html']],
});
```

### Merge Sharded Reports

```bash
# After all shards complete, merge blob reports
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-blob-reports
```

## Environment Management

### Environment Variables

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Load env file based on environment
dotenv.config({ path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}` });

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  },
});
```

### Multiple Environments

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        environment: [staging, production]
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: npx playwright test
        env:
          BASE_URL: ${{ matrix.environment == 'staging' && 'https://staging.example.com' || 'https://example.com' }}
          TEST_USER: ${{ secrets[format('TEST_USER_{0}', matrix.environment)] }}
```

### Secrets Management

```yaml
# GitHub Actions secrets
- name: Run tests
  run: npx playwright test
  env:
    TEST_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.TEST_EMAIL }}
    TEST_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TEST_PASSWORD }}
```

```typescript
// tests use environment variables
test('login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.getByLabel('Email').fill(process.env.TEST_EMAIL!);
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(process.env.TEST_PASSWORD!);
});
```

## Caching

### Cache Playwright Browsers

```yaml
- name: Cache Playwright browsers
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  id: playwright-cache
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
    key: playwright-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}

- name: Install Playwright browsers
  if: steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

- name: Install system deps only
  if: steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit == 'true'
  run: npx playwright install-deps
```

### Cache Node Modules

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 20
    cache: 'npm'

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

## Best Practices

| Practice                      | Benefit                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Use `npm ci`                  | Deterministic installs    |
| Run headless in CI            | Faster, no display needed |
| Set retries in CI only        | Handle flakiness          |
| Upload artifacts on failure   | Debug failures            |
| Use sharding for large suites | Faster execution          |
| Cache browsers                | Faster setup              |
| Use blob reporter for shards  | Merge reports correctly   |

## CI Configuration Reference

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts - CI optimized
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: process.env.CI ? [['github'], ['blob'], ['html']] : [['list'], ['html']],
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'on-first-retry',
  },
});
```
